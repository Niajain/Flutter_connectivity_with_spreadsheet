A new Flutter project.

Introduction
Welcome to the Flutter Spreadsheet Integration project! This project demonstrates how to connect a Flutter application with a spreadsheet, enabling seamless data exchange between the two platforms. By leveraging the Flutter framework and Google Sheets API, we empower developers to build dynamic and interactive mobile applications that interact with spreadsheet data stored in the cloud.

Project Overview
In today's digital age, businesses and individuals rely heavily on spreadsheets for organizing, analyzing, and sharing data. With the proliferation of mobile devices, there's a growing demand for mobile applications that can seamlessly integrate with spreadsheet platforms to access and manipulate data on the go.

This project aims to bridge the gap between mobile app development and spreadsheet functionality by showcasing how to:

Establish a connection between a Flutter application and a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
Retrieve, update, and manipulate spreadsheet data from within the Flutter app.
Demonstrate real-time synchronization between the Flutter app and the connected spreadsheet.
Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with spreadsheet data on mobile devices.

Key Features
Authentication: Securely authenticate users and authorize access to Google Sheets using OAuth 2.0.
Data Retrieval: Fetch data from specific sheets and ranges within the connected spreadsheet.
Data Manipulation: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on spreadsheet data.
Real-Time Updates: Enable real-time updates to reflect changes made in the spreadsheet within the Flutter app.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage connectivity issues and data synchronization conflicts.
